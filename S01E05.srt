1
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,090
永远别把龙舌兰酒和威士忌混在一起喝
Never mix tequila and scotch.

2
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,600
早上好  查理伯伯
Morning, Uncle Charlie.

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,570
杰克老兄
Jake, buddy.

4
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,100
爸爸说你一定起不来看我踢球的
Dad said you'd never get up to go to soccer with me.

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,880
但我说  他答应我的  看来他错了
But I said, he promised. So he was wrong.

6
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,810
什么?
What?

7
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,220
你知道吗  大多数父母穿短裤还抹防晒霜
You know, most of the parents wear shorts and lots of sunscreen,

8
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,920
不过你这样打扮也没问题
but that's another way to go.

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,490
艾伦  足球赛我去看不成  我刚从拉斯维加斯回来
Alan, I can't go to a soccer game. I just got home from Vegas.

10
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,350
你昨晚是去还录像带的呀
You went out last night to return a video.

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,130
我碰巧遇到个准备在美丽湖酒店结婚的朋友
I ran into a friend of mine who was getting married at the Bellagio.

12
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,630
难怪你会穿这身燕尾服
That explains the tuxedo.

13
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,780
不  我印象中穿这个好像是为了别的事儿
No, I think this was for something else entirely.

14
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,810
我相信我会在报纸上读到的
I'm sure I'll read about it in the paper.

15
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,270
我是这周负责足球赛供应点心的小二  
Anyway, I am the Soccer Snack Buddy this week,

16
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,680
所以我得去趟杂货店
so I've gotta stop at the grocery store.

17
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,850
要不等车来了之后你和杰克去比赛场吧?
Why don't you ride to the game with Jake when the van gets here?

18
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,320
我有个更好的主意
I got a better idea.

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,960
我还是上楼呕吐之后  穿着衣服睡上12个小时好些吧?
Why don't I go upstairs, throw up and sleep in my clothes for 12 hours?

20
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,690
行啊  但如果你不去看比赛
Fine, but if you're not gonna come,

21
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,680
-你得自己跟杰克说去  -好啊  他会理解我的
-you gotta tell Jake yourself. -Fine. He'll understand.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,500
-杰克?  -我有新鞋子啦
-Jake? -I got new cleats.

23
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,310
不错  听着  杰克  宝贝
Nice. Listen, Jake, buddy.

24
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,800
你有没有去过拉斯维加斯?
Have you ever been to Vegas?

25
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,310
你就是那个臭名昭著的查理伯伯?
So you're the infamous Uncle Charlie.

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,860
久仰大名
I've heard about you.

27
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,100
好汉两个半 
第一季  第五集

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,200
所有人下车  小心碰头  一个接一个下
Everybody out. Watch your heads. One at a time.

29
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,710
-游戏时间  -快呀
-Party time. -Come on.

30
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,020
是这样的  查理伯伯  我觉得你很迷人
Here's the deal, Uncle Charlie. I find you attractive.

31
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,250
我有三个孩子  一个混球前夫
I have three kids, a bastard of an ex-husband,

32
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,420
一周在我自己开的旅行社工作50个小时
I work 50 hours a week at my own travel agency,

33
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,950
我现在是性高涨时期
I'm at the peak of my sexuality,

34
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,760
周三孩子们去学跆拳道的时候我有空
I have a three-hour window Wednesdays when the kids are at tae kwon do.

35
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,490
你意下如何?
You in or out?

36
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:36,030
不好意思  我宿醉后还没完全清醒而且刚还被鞋子踢到要害了
I'm sorry, I'm terminally hung over and I just took a cleat in the groin.

37
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,330
有空给我发邮件吧  人人都上歌罗瑞亚@aol.com
E-mail me. Allaboardgloria @aol.com.

38
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,850
哪一个是你家小孩?
So, which one's yours?

39
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,350
请不要让我讲话
Please don't make me talk.

40
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,630
这位是查理・哈勃  艾伦・哈勃的兄长
This is Charlie Harper. Alan Harper's brother.

41
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,730
-哪边赢家?  -没有赢家
-So, who's winning? -No one.

42
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,130
我们不计分的  我们认为小孩儿只是为了乐趣而玩比较健康
We don't keep score. We think it's healthier if the kids just play for fun.

43
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,630
你说笑呢  对吧?
You're yanking me, right?

44
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,410
朱蒂丝提醒我们说你是个刺头
Judith warned us that you were a pistol.

45
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,310
对了  我们对于她和艾伦的事感到遗憾
By the way, we were so sorry to hear about her and Alan.

46
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,680
跟我们说说  那是真的吗?
So tell us, is it true?

47
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,480
朱蒂丝真是因为别的女人才离开你弟弟的吗?
Did Judith leave your brother for another woman?

48
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,370
-你们干嘛不自己问朱蒂丝?  -我们不想太过八卦而已
-Why don't you ask Judith? -We wouldn't want to pry.

49
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,060
女士们  我失陪一下
Ladies, if you'll excuse me,

50
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,790
因为我得离开  见鬼  我干嘛要解释原因
I have to go because, hell, I don't need a reason.

51
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,630
有些人很自以为是嘛
Someone's a little full of himself.

52
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,330
不管他  赛场上的那个是他弟弟的小孩
Forget him. His brother's the one who's in play.

53
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,570
杰克怎么样了?
How's Jake doing?

54
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:48,640
杰克多好  他才十岁  他还有大好前程呢
Jake's fine. He's 10. He's got his whole life ahead of him.

55
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,110
而我  从另一方面讲
Me, on the other hand,

56
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:54,780
坐在大太阳下  穿着租来的裤子还得听着自己眨眼睛的噪音
I'm sitting in the hot sun, in rented pants listening to myself blink.

57
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,280
我还是问别人吧
I'll ask somebody else.

58
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,450
怎么了?
What?

59
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:08,620
抱歉  我忍不住偷听到  你看起来实在太
Sorry. I couldn't help overhearing, and you just look so

60
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,990
可悲了
pathetic.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,470
是么?  晚礼服店的人说我看起来光彩夺目
Really? The guy at the tux shop said I looked dashing.

62
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,270
当然  那是昨天说的
Of course, that was yesterday.

63
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,270
之后我就在口袋里发现了他的电话号码
And I found his phone number in my pocket.

64
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:23,010
-什么情况?  -还录影带而已
-What was the occasion? -Just returning a video.

65
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,060
-查理・哈勃  -凯特・麦克拉林
-Charlie Harper. -Kate McLaughlin.

66
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,650
让我来问你几个问题  凯特・麦克拉林
Let me ask you something, Kate McLaughlin.

67
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,180
你对于比赛不计分这事儿怎么看?
What's your take on this whole no-keeping-score thing?

68
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,450
我觉得这是我见过最蠢的事儿
I think it's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

69
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,520
我能坐你旁边吗  这里比较安全
Can I stay here next to you where it's safe?

70
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,020
可以啊
Sure.

71
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,700
哪个是你家小孩?
So, which one's yours?

72
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,030
九号  不过我不是他爸
Number nine. But I'm not the father.

73
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,730
看来你不擅长运动啊
Aren't you a good sport?

74
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,570
杰克  我再说最后一次
Jake, for the last time,

75
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,580
没有人"兴奋"  没人赢也没人输
nobody got "creamed." No one won, no one lost.

76
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,080
好啊  除了我们  12比2
Yeah. Except for us. 12-2.

77
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:08,090
输赢并不重要  重要的是你有没有被痛宰
It doesn't matter if you win or lose. It's whether or not you beat the spread.

78
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,060
真是谢谢你了  查理  杰克  洗澡去
Thank you, Charlie. Jake, go take a shower.

79
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,830
查理  我们在教孩子不要去计分
Charlie, we are trying to teach the kids not to keep score.

80
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:20,060
你在教他们数数前应该想到这个
You should've thought of that before you taught them to count.

81
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,230
顺便问一下  你和杰克明天有什么安排?
By the way, what are you doing with Jake tomorrow?

82
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,600
没计划呢  怎么啦?
I don't know. Why?

83
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,240
我帮他和球队的孩子约了个"游玩日"
I made a play date for him with one of the kids from the game.

84
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,240
你想吊人家小孩的妈了  对吧?
You're hitting on the mother, aren't you?

85
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,580
什么都逃不过你的法眼  对吧?
Can't slip one past you, can I?

86
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,250
"游玩日"不该是为了这个
That's not what a play date is for.

87
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,420
怎么?  小孩可以玩  我也可以约会  一举多得啊
What? The kid plays, I have a date. Everybody wins.

88
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,590
-一举多得?  -是呀
-Everybody wins? -Yes.

89
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,060
但我保证不计分好吧
But I promise not to keep score.

90
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,290
查理  你不能利用我儿子去钓单身母亲的
Charlie, you cannot use my son to pick up single mothers.

91
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,790
但我可以
But I can.

92
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,600
晚安  点心大叔
Good night, Snack Buddy.

93
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,730
不准去水边  不准扔石头  还有记住
No going in the water, no throwing rocks, and remember,

94
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,100
如果你们看不到我们  我们也看不到你们
if you can't see us, we can't see you.

95
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,310
你还有什么要补充的  查理?
Is there anything you'd like to add, Charlie?

96
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,430
-为什么他们不能扔石头?  -玩去吧
-Why can't they throw rocks? -Go.

97
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,650
厄尼喜欢在海滩玩  谢谢你邀请他
Ernie loves the beach. Thanks for inviting him.

98
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,460
为了孩子怎么都好  他们可是我们的未来
Anything for the kids. They're our future.

99
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,320
-艾伦在哪儿呢?  -我让他看电影去了
-So, where's Alan? -I sent him to the movies.

100
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,820
他应该休息休息  这样我也可以好好陪陪杰克
He deserves a break, and I get some quality uncle time with Jake.

101
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,990
我觉得你人真好
I think that is really nice of you.

102
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,830
厄尼  别脱鞋袜
Ernie, keep your socks with your shoes.

103
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,160
抱歉  说到哪儿了?
I'm sorry, where was l?

104
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,130
你说我人很好之类的
You were saying I was nice about something.

105
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,800
你在雪曼橡树区住了多久啦?
How long have you lived in Sherman Oaks?

106
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,270
我们搬来有...  厄尼  把那个放下  那是死的
We moved in and... Ernie, put that down, it's dead.

107
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,310
小孩什么都捡  无论那东西看起来像什么
That kid'll pick up anything, no matter what it looks like.

108
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,810
明白
Been there.

109
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,610
我们搬来的时候正好赶上地震...
Anyway, We moved in just in time for the earthquake...

110
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,250
厄尼  我不会再说一遍了
Ernie, I am not gonna say it again.

111
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,780
把那个死东西放下
Put the dead thing down.

112
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,790
杰克  你可能也该把你那个死东西放下
Jake, you should probably put your dead thing down, too.

113
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,130
-小孩嘛  -我明白  他们只是...
-Kids. -I know. They're just...

114
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,030
厄尼  把那放下否则我们立马离开
Ernie, put it down or we're leaving right now.

115
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,860
我数到三  一  二
I'm counting to three. One, two...

116
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,970
厄尼  求你了  我要被你整死了
Ernie, for God's sake, you're killing me here.

117
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,470
-谢谢  -不客气
-Thank you. -No problem.

118
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,540
-你在洛杉矶长大的吗?  -不是
-So, did you grow up in L.A.? -No.

119
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,210
我爸参了军所以我们搬到...
My dad was in the Army so we moved around...

120
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,110
见鬼  那东西还没死
Hell, that thing's not dead.

121
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,350
我很希望深入了解你  但带着孩子绝对不行
I'd like to get to know you, it's not gonna happen on a play date.

122
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,650
-不如改天约我好了?  -那真是太好...
-why donn't you ask me out sometime? -That's a really good...

123
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:24,520
你满意了吧?  我早让你放下的  厄尼
Are you happy? I told you to put it down, Ernie.

124
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,990
把沙子拍掉  别  别碰它
Get the sand off of it. No. Don't touch it.

125
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:32,990
-你哪天有空啊?  -杰克  你别帮倒忙了
-What night's good for you? -Jake, you're not helping.

126
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,830
-不要等我啦  -回拉斯维加斯呀?
-Don't wait up. -Back to Vegas?

127
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,410
比那儿更好  雪曼橡树区
Even better. Sherman Oaks.

128
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,410
通往凡奈之路(加利福尼亚)
The gateway to Van Nuys.

129
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,080
又是凯特?
Kate again?

130
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,650
查理  你根本不知道牵扯上这些足球小子的妈妈
Charlie, You have no clue what you're getting involved in

131
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,890
-会有什么结果  -你说的没错
-with these divorced soccer moms. -You're right.

132
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,890
我是不明白  也没明白过  这就是我的魅力之所在
I don't have a clue. I've never had a clue. It's part of my charm.

133
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:04,060
那至少记住这些妇女会互通有无的
At least keep in mind that all these women talk to each other.

134
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,360
所以不管你做什么  都会传到我老婆那儿
So anything you do will get back to my wife,

135
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,600
最后无端变成我的错
and somehow become my fault.

136
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,100
这貌似不公平
That doesn't seem fair.

137
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,210
你要干嘛去?
So, where are you going?

138
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,940
我去帮歌罗瑞亚弄足球联盟的简报
I'm helping Gloria with the soccer league newsletter.

139
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,960
我想命名为"只为踢球"
I'm thinking of calling it "Just For Kicks."

140
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,750
等等  这和开车送小孩的歌罗瑞亚是同一个人么?
wait a minute. This is the same Gloria who drives the kid van?

141
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,610
-是呀  怎么啦?  -没什么  玩的愉快
-Yeah. Why? -Nothing. Have fun.

142
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,060
走着瞧  看谁不明白
Talk about not having a clue.

143
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,690
我设计了一个标识
And I designed a logo,

144
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,960
"踢"的偏旁旁边有个小脚丫
the "K" in "Kicks" is a little foot.

145
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,030
听起来不错
Sounds wonderful.

146
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:46,140
让你花时间来做这个我真是不知道怎么感谢你
I can't thank you enough for taking the time to do this.

147
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,210
为了孩子嘛
Anything for the kids.

148
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,140
你真是个好父亲
You're such a good father.

149
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,880
朱蒂丝不懂得欣赏你是她的损失
It's a shame that Judith didn't appreciate you.

150
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,610
她只是需要点时间整理思绪
She just needed a little time to sort things out.

151
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,310
但没错  是她的损失
But, yeah. It's a shame.

152
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,950
看看你
Look at you.

153
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:05,290
一个成功的脊椎按摩师  集智慧和细心于一身
A successful chiropractor, intelligent, dedicated.

154
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,790
说的我都不好意思了
You're embarrassing me.

155
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,790
抱歉啦
I'm sorry.

156
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,040
咱们还是说说你的小标识吧
Let's get back to your little logo.

157
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,260
-怎么啦?  -没事儿
-What's wrong? -Nothing.

158
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,840
是我的脖子  大概睡姿有问题吧
It's my neck. I must have slept wrong.

159
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,140
到我诊所预约好了  我看看能不能治好
Make an appointment with my office, we'll see if we can fix that.

160
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,640
别呀  我会不好意思的
No, I'd feel funny.

161
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,680
我们可认识对方呀
We know each other.

162
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,250
别傻了  那是我该做的
Don't be silly. It's what I do.

163
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,750
转身  转过去  转吧
Turn around. Turn around. Go ahead.

164
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,830
-你补钙补得够着呢吧?  -是吧
-Are you getting enough calcium? -I guess.

165
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:46,770
钙质对于你这个年纪的女人很重要的
It's really important for a woman your age.

166
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,180
骨质疏松可是个严重问题
Osteoporosis is a real problem.

167
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,740
还有椎间盘突出啦
Curvature of the spine.

168
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,100
你肯定不想变成驼背吧
Last thing you want is to wind up with a hump.

169
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,190
希望你们没在我来之前就开始了
I hope you didn't start without me.

170
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,320
-你说什么呢?  -比尔  你是故意那么做的
-What are you talking about? -Bill, you did this on purpose.

171
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,660
你故意来晚好能偷偷监视我
You showed up late so you could snoop on me.

172
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,960
-你见过我女朋友了啊  -什么呀  她是我们的保姆
-You got to meet my girlfriend. -What meet? She was our babysitter.

173
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,770
你能不能给我滚出去  比尔?
Will you get out of here, Bill?

174
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:26,690
凯特  我也想呀  厄尼  能不能把鞋穿上?
Kate, I'm trying. Ernie, would you put your shoes on?

175
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,880
-比尔  -查理
-Bill. -Charlie.

176
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,490
那是你的捷豹(福特跑车)?
That your Jag?

177
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,330
-是呀  -不错
-Yeah. -It's nice.

178
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,800
我的领航者(林肯越野车)在那儿
I got the Navigator over there.

179
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,870
也很不错嘛
That's nice, too.

180
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,380
走吧  老爸
Let's go, Dad.

181
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,910
那就这样吧  你想办法哄她开心好了
All right, then. You try and make her happy.

182
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,390
事实上  我觉得吓到我前夫的是
Truthfully, I think that my ex was intimidated

183
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,890
我的性的...
by my sexual...

184
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,150
我不知道该怎么说  胃口吧
I don't even know, how to say it. Appetite.

185
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,870
所以我们都同意了编辑区旁留六英寸?
So we're agreed we'll set aside six inches for the editorial column?

186
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,380
抱歉哈  是的  六英寸
I'm sorry. Yes, six inches.

187
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,380
我不知道怎么就跑题了
I don't know how I got so off-topic.

188
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,790
我很清楚你是怎么跑题的
I know exactly how you got off-topic.

189
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,750
好了  我想下来该决定纸的颜色了
ok. I think the next piece of business is to decide on the paper color.

190
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,760
我带了些样本  我们有
I brought some samples. We've got

191
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,850
菊花色  鲑鱼色  芥末色...
goldenrod, salmon, mustard...

192
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,430
听到你说小菊花我就动心了
You had me at goldenrod.

193
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,740
人人都知道你喜欢小菊花
Everybody has you at goldenrod.

194
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:08,270
我弟弟艾伦提醒我今晚不要和你约会
My brother, Alan, warned me not to go out with you tonight.

195
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,610
真有趣
That's funny.

196
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,780
每个人都提醒我不要和你出来约会
Everybody warned me not to go out with you.

197
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,610
对罗密欧和朱丽叶来说就没问题
It worked for Romeo and Juliet,

198
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:19,270
直到他们喝下毒药和自杀之前
up until the poison and the stabbing.

199
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,790
查理  我要坦白件事儿
Charlie, I have a confession.

200
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,820
十二年来除了我老公我没和其他男人约会过
I haven't been out with a man other than my husband in 12 years.

201
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,220
这不是问题
That's not a problem.

202
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,990
虽然很多事变了  但我可以帮你跟上时代的步伐
A couple of things have changed, I can bring you up to date.

203
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,460
愿闻其详
Please do.

204
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,830
好吧  如今的用餐都是女人付账
All right, well, nowadays, women pay for dinner.

205
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,270
当然  饭后嘿咻是死规定
And of course, sex is a given.

206
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:45,410
那我至少要告诉你  我是不会为晚餐付账的
I'll tell you one thing, I am not paying for dinner.

207
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,910
可恶
Rats.

208
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:53,020
时间不早  我们也该走了
Look at the time. Maybe we should get going.

209
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,690
在歌罗瑞亚那么多孩子回来之前
Give Gloria a chance for a little quiet time before

210
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,440
我们还是让她享受一下这片刻的宁静吧
her many, many kids come home.

211
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,160
我不需要宁静
I don't need any quiet time.

212
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,360
别傻啦
Don't be silly.

213
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,360
艾伦  你介不介意送我回家啊?
Alan, would you mind driving me home?

214
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,000
我有点儿醉意
I'm feeling a little tipsy.

215
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,370
有点儿醉意?  是有点明显吧?
A little tipsy? How about a little obvious?

216
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,170
-你说什么?  -我能单独跟你谈谈么?
-I'm sorry? -Could I talk to you for a minute?

217
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:15,900
-时间不早了  -给我坐下
-lt is getting a little late. -Sit down.

218
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,680
我们马上回来
We'll be right back.

219
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,250
我觉得她是更年期综合征
I think she's going through the change.

220
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,980
-你以为你在干什么?  -什么?
-What do you think you're doing? -What?

221
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,880
他在我的游戏之中  我掌控着游戏
He's in play. I'm playing.

222
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,220
是我告诉你他在游戏之中的吧
I'm the one who told you he's in play.

223
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,620
拜托  两年前我就告诉过你他的婚姻快黄了
Please. I told you two years ago that marriage was toast.

224
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,160
那又怎样?
So what?

225
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,660
周三跆拳道的空档他在我家
He's in my house on tae kwon do Wednesday,

226
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,000
我没时间跟你胡闹
and I don't have time to mess around with you.

227
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,130
我们不如让他决定好了?
Why don't we just let him decide?

228
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,700
让他决定?
Let him decide?

229
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,120
他还以为我们在做足球简报呢
He still thinks we're doing a soccer newsletter.

230
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,590
-你甚至都不喜欢他  不是吗  -他还好啦
-You don't even like him, do you? -He's okay.

231
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,900
他在这儿而且又是周三
He's here and it's Wednesday.

232
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,580
我正好觉得他很性感
I happen to think he's hot.

233
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,050
性感的家伙你应付不来的
You wouldn't know what to do with a hot guy.

234
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,550
是么?  瞧我的吧
Yeah? Well, watch me.

235
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,990
很好  你把他弄坏了
Great. You broke him.

236
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,670
最意外的是我喜欢他在我身边
The biggest surprise was how much I loved having him around.

237
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,540
我是说杰克很棒
I mean, Jake's amazing.

238
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:25,180
你知道吗  我有时候会把他的需求放在我的之前?
Do you know I have, on occasion, actually put his needs ahead of my own?

239
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,880
就像是周六早上八点看球赛?
Like going to a soccer game at 8:00 am on a Saturday?

240
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,010
没错
Yes.

241
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:32,950
早上八点我连下床去厕所都难
At 8:00 am, I can barely get out of bed to go to the bathroom.

242
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,550
你是说在你的生命中有个孩子
What you're saying is having a child in your life

243
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,690
完全改变的你看待事物的方式
totally changes the way you look at things.

244
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,190
就是这样
Exactly.

245
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,430
当然  也许你已经知道了
Of course, you probably know that already.

246
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,070
但我很高兴你也知道
But I like that you know it.

247
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,920
-今晚很愉快  -我也是
-I had a really great time. -Me, too.

248
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,600
-我们能再出来玩吗  -我很乐意啊
-Can we do this again? -I would love that.

249
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,100
太好了
Great.

250
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:11,470
发生什么事儿了?  我做错什么了吗?
What happened? Did I do something wrong?

251
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,260
千万别告诉艾伦他老婆
Please don't tell Alan's wife.

252
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,270
不  你什么也没做错
No, you didn't do anything wrong.

253
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,130
我真的很喜欢你
I really like you.

254
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,270
好吧  这对我还是新鲜事儿
Okay. This is new for me.

255
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,470
只是...
It's just...

256
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,610
查理  我有个十岁的儿子
Charlie, I have a 10-year-old son.

257
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,050
还有两份抵押贷款  私立学校的账单

我们怎么可能再出来约会?
How can we possibly do this again?

261
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,170
你给十岁的小孩子买了架子鼓?
You bought a 10-year-old a drum set?

262

别转移话题  你知道我在说什么
Don't change the subject. You know what I'm saying.

263
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,790
你真的想牵扯进来吗?
Do you really want to be involved in this?

264

00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,630
好啦  我们改天见吧
All right. I guess I'll see you around.

267

-回家呀  -为什么?

269
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,430
我说我们不能再约  可那不代表我们今晚
I said we couldn't do it again. That doesn't mean we can't

270
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,930
也不能做

271
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,540
老兄  你还真是什么都不明白  对吧  查理?
Boy, you really don't have a clue, do you, Charlie?

272
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,770
不明白
No.

273
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:38,940

276
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,200
-一般的吧  -谢天谢地
-Regular. -Thank God.

277
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,410
你都不好奇吗?
Aren't you even curious?

278
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,350
-你昨晚去歌罗瑞亚家了嘛  -是呀
-You went to Gloria's last night. -Yeah.

279
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,850
其他就不言自明了
I can fill in the blanks.

280
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,560
我们输惨了
We're getting killed.

281

We're here for fun, right? Nobody wins or loses.

282
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,980
得了吧  有人老输
Come on. Somebody always loses.

283
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,270
我们要骗谁呀?
Who are we kidding?

284
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,740
已经是8比1了，大家都心知肚明
It's 8-1 out there, and everybody here knows it.

285
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,410
知道吗  我还要说一件事儿
And you know, I'll tell you another thing.

286
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,110
我们这季都没有赢过
We haven't won a game all season.

287
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,720
而且我会把它写入简报的
And I'll put that in the newsletter.

288
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,220
老天作证
And as God as my witness,

289
